        <p>Welcome to the Pop-Up Institute, Seeing the Tree and the Forest: Understanding Individual and Population Variation in Biology, Medicine, and Society!</p>

        <p>In May 2017, this *Pop-Up Institute* will bring together experts from the Natural Sciences, Liberal Arts, and the Dell Medical School to collaborate across traditional research boundaries.  From the sciences to the humanities, these diverse researchers are pursing the same fundamental questions about the causes and consequences of individual and population variation.  Individuals differ in a myriad of ways, from their genetics to their lifetime health. Understanding this variation is critically important for promoting the success of individuals and the populations within which they live.  We aim to 1) Identify fundamental similarities and shared research goals across disciplines; 2) Establish a unique, integrative, and collaborative research plan; and 3) Develop solutions to shared problems that currently limit progress.  Together, we will launch ongoing collaborations to conduct groundbreaking research with real-world, positive outcomes for humans and society.</p>
